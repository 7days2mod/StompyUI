# StompyUI
A graphical Overhaul of the Game UI for 7 days to die

This UI is a work in progress.
Current version is compatible with Alpha 15.1

It is using inclusion of atlas="ItemIconAtlas" for most of the UI sprites to allow for the use of the mods folder icons. If this UI is used on a server then the Mods folder must be installed on the client as well for it to operate correctly.
